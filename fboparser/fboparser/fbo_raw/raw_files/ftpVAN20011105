The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) in an effort to improve medical supply support to our customers has developed the Electronic Catalog (ECAT) System.  The ECAT System allows DSCP (CONUS AND OCONUS) customers to review and compare contractor electronic catalogs with the ultimate goal of placing on-line orders to the contractor of their choice.

DSCP military and other government customers are currently using the ECAT System to order medically related laboratory, dental and optical supplies and limited medical equipment.

DSCP Medical Equipment Group intends to enter into firm fixed-price with economic price adjustment, indefinite quantity type contracts for medical equipment, maintenance of medical equipment, and/or spare parts/repair parts of medical equipment used by medical professionals, technicians and laboratory personnel to perform a treatment, test or operation.  All items are brand name specific or generic commercial products, which are identified by the manufacturer's item descriptions and part numbers and conform to the manufacturer's commercial specifications.  This Open Season solicitation is a continuation of the multiple award contract initiative originating under RFP SP0200-01-R-8000.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  The resultant contract(s) will be for a five-year base term. 

We are soliciting for Contractors' entire medical equipment product lines.  A sampling of the products to be contracted are: defibrillators, pulse oximeters, aspirators, ventilators, examination tables/surgical tables, repair parts/spare parts, dental systems/handpieces, infusion pumps, suction apparatus, resuscitators, patient monitors, electrocardiographs, analyzers/test equipment, anesthesia apparatus, medical furniture, hospital beds/chairs/stretchers, laboratory analyzers, small portable ultrasounds, litters, lasers, and medical equipment maintenance.  Along with these items, the following may be required: classroom training, repair parts, maintenance of the item(s) and installation when applicable as well as all consumable and nonconsumable items used in conjunction with any and all medical equipment.

Items and maintenance thereof, excluded from this solicitation are: ultrasounds (other than small portable ultrasounds), diagnostic X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging systems, nuclear medicine, Computed Tomography, Magnetoencephalography, Pet Scanner, Cyclotron, Radiation Oncology, Lithotripsy and PACS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

The Contracting office anticipates issuing a Request For Proposal (RFP) using FAR Part 12 and 15 for a one-year basic performance period (does not include a 4 month transition period) with seven (7) one-year option periods.  The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price.  The Contractor will perform the above function in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW), and supporting guidance. This action is under 100% small-business set-aside with a NAICS code of 562219 and a size standard of  $10.0 M.  The anticipated issue date is on or about 4 Dec 01  with a closing date of on or about 17 Jan 02.  The anticipated site visit date is 11 Dec 01.  A draft copy of the Source Solicitation Requirements document, Statement of Work (SOW) w/appendixes, and draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) is posted at the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fedbizops.gov).  Request interested parties review the drafts and comment on the overall content of the SOW, the source selection documents, QASP, and their relationship to standard commercial practices for this type operation.  The Government believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  Also indicate how long would you anticipate the site visit to last.  Any comments provided would not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.  All comments shall be forwarded to 16CONS/LGCY, 350 Tully St, Hurlburt Fld, FL  32544; or via e-mail to: Twila Beasley.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business against the size standard.  This is a paperless acquisition.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations having the capability to act as a centralized repository for compounds from domestic and international investigators, commercial sources, and pharmaceutical companies.  The contract will involve the receipt, purchase, storage and analysis of compounds from various sources, and the shipment of these compounds to domestic and international test sites, as well as maintenance of an extensive inventory and tracking system. The major goal of this project is to provide NIDA with a holding site which has the capability to inventory, analyze and store compounds, prepared under both GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) and non-GMP conditions, in amounts ranging from milligram quantities to several kilograms.  As some of the compounds may be scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, demonstration of proper DEA registration and adequate security is mandatory.  In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that offerors possess a DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five years with options for additional quantities of work each year.  RFP No. N01DA-2-8821 will be available electronically on or about November 15,2001, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NIDA website at the following address: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html).  Please note that the RFP for this acquisition will be streamlined to include only the Work Statement, Deliverables, Reporting Requirements, Special Requirements, Mandatory Qualifications, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and other necessary Proposal Preparation Instructions.  However, all information required for the submission of an offer will be contained in or accessible through the electronic RFP package.  Response to the RFP will be due on or about January 3, 2002.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  See note No. 26.

<DESC>Initiative: This Sources Sought announcement is hereby submitted by the Area Attack System Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, Florida.  The Air Force plans to contract for the development of a common Precision Guided Munitions Planning Software (PGMPS) Program.  This acquisition was cancelled last year due to lack of funding.  Funding is now confirmed to be available.  However, this announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  Objective: PGMPS shall be a Unique Planning Component (UPC) of the USAF Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The overall program objective is to provide a single PGM mission planning application integrated with JMPS.  PGMPS shall provide a common user interface for all PGM mission planning and a single interface control document (ICD) to define the integration with carrier aircraft UPCs.  PGMPS must be compliant with the Defense Information Infrastructure-Common Operating Environment (DII-COE) to the same level specified for JMPS.  Contract Scope and Award: The basic contract shall deliver mission planning software for the Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW), and the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser (WCMD) in the initial release (version 1.0); if funding is provided, Version 1.0 will be followed by another release (version 2.0, one year later) that will include the addition of the Small Diameter Bomb.  A planned third release will add the AGM-130, GBU-15, and EGBU-15 weapons to PGMPS.   Version 1.0 must include a common PGMPS UPC-to-Aircraft UPC ICD that governs the integration of PGMPS with all applicable aircraft mission-planning applications. It is anticipated that the contract shall include several options for software upgrades to accommodate changes driven by the JMPS framework, integration of additional aircraft with the existing PGMPS, and the probability of adding additional weapons.  Version 1.0 must be delivered, certified for operational test, not later than February 2004 (assuming the JMPS schedule does not significantly slip).  Version 2.0 must be fielded by February 2005, and follow-on releases shall occur annually in February of each subsequent year.   An RFP release date of March 2002 is anticipated with a subsequent contract award planned for September 2002.  Statement of Capability (SOC): Interested firms should submit a SOC within 30 days of this announcement to Ms. Robin A. Mayberry, AAC/YHK, 102 West D Avenue, Suite 300, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6808.  The SOC must include, but is not limited to, successful experience or capability as a contractor in: (1) integrating Government-provided software and contractor-developed software, (2) the development, integration, and testing of mission planning software and weapon-specific mission planning software, and (3) facilities and personnel to handle and store classified information at the TOP SECRET level. Contractors that have previously submitted a SOC for this effort as synopsized under solicitation number F08635-00-R-0005 need only submit a letter stating any applicable changes and addressing their size standard for the herein cited NAICS code.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.   Small Business: Firms responding to this synopsis should state whether or not they are a small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone certified, woman-owned, historically black college or university or any other minority concern as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-1 and FAR 52.219-2. The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition shall be 541511 with a size standard of $18M.  A decision as to whether this acquisition shall be full and open competition or small business set-aside shall be based on responses to this synopsis and other market research.
